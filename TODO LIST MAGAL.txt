1) teacher needs to be able to see the answers the students submitted to homeworks 
	(he can go to classX=>homework_number_y=>answers=>gets a list of all answers submitted to that homework by members of classX)


2) !!NEW!! every time a teacher logs in, access their schoolclasses, and check

		if so, notify the teacher that homeworks are ready to be checked.
		you can find the answers to this homework through, for example,
			answerService.All().Where(ans => ans.Homework_Id == .....)
